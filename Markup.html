    <pr>Coding is hard
    <br>Coding is complex</br>
    But still, I am giving my heart
    <br>And <strong>trying my best</strong></br>

    At first, coding was devastating
    <br>It literally shook my mind</br>
    But, when I actually solved coding problems
    <br>Coding became quite <em>worth my time</em></br>

    <br></br>
    <pr>
    It's been some time now
      <br>And I am proud of my <em>little works/></br>
    I didn't ask why, <strong>but I asked how</strong>
    <br>Coding is difficult, but it has its perks</br>
