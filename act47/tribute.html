            Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means 
            "cool breeze over the mountains" in Hawaiian, 
            was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. 
            He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl 
            and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, 
            a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, 
            of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese 
            ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from England.

            <p id="note">
                <mark>Personal Note:</mark><br>Why I admire Keanu Reeves is not just for his good acting
                but also because of his perosnality and behaviour, he is a natural good natured person.
                Even though he makes a lot of profit from his films, he does not get
                ahead of himself. He is humble and down-to-earth actor and person.
