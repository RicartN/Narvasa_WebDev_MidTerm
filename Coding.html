    Coding is hard
    <br>Coding is difficult</br>
    But still, I am giving my heart
    <br>And trying my best</br>
    <br></br>
    At first coding was devastating
    <br>It literally shook my mind</br>
    But, when I actually solved coding problems
    <br>Coding became quite worth my time</br>
    <br></br>
    It's been some time now
    <br>And I am proud of my little works</br>
    I didn't ask why, but I asked how
    <br>Coding is difficult, but it has its perks
